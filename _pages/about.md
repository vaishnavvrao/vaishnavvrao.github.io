ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ! (Namaskara!) I am Vai, a PhD Student at the University of Michigan. I like studying how galaxies form and evolve by resolving their stellar populations and reconstructing their formation histories. I also like hunting for the most dark-matter dominated systems in the Universe called ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs), that typically live in stellar halos of other big, nearby galaxies.
