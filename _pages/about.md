Namaskara! I am Vai, a PhD Student at the University of Michigan. I like studying how galaxies form and evolve by resolving their stellar populations and reconstructing their formation histories. I also like hunting for the most dark-matter dominated systems in the Universe called ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs), that typically live in stellar halos of other big, nearby galaxies. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
