ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ! (Namaskara!) I am Vai, a PhD student at the University of Michigan. I enjoy studying how galaxies form and evolve by resolving their stellar populations and reconstructing their formation histories. I am also passionate about hunting for ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) in the Local Universe. These are among the most dark matter-dominated systems in the Universe, and they typically reside as satellites in the stellar halos of larger galaxies.
